Problem 1

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
random_df = rnorm(10)
logic_vector = random_df > 0
character_vector = c("1","2","3","1","2","3", "1","2","3","2")
factor_vector = factor(c("x","y","z","x","y","z", "x","y","z","y"))
```

```{r}
R = mean(random_df)
L = mean(logic_vector)
C = mean(character_vector)
F = mean(factor_vector)
R
L
C
F
```

```{r}
as.numeric(logic_vector)
as.numeric(character_vector)
as.numeric(factor_vector)
```



Problem 2

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```


```{r}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
summary(penguins)
n_row = nrow(penguins)
n_col = ncol(penguins)
colnames(penguins)
b = pull(penguins, var = flipper_length_mm)
summary(b)
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm)) + geom_point(aes(color = species))
```

There are `r n_row` rows and `r n_col` columns in the dataset. Including `r colnames(penguins)` in total 8 variables, and the describtion of them are `r summary(penguins)`. The mean of flipper length is 200.9.
