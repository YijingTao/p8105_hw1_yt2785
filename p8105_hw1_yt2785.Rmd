Problem 1

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
random_df = rnorm(10)
logic_vector = random_df > 0
character_vector = c("1","2","3","1","2","3", "1","2","3","2")
factor_vector = factor(c("x","y","z","x","y","z", "x","y","z","y"))
```

```{r}
R = mean(random_df)
L = mean(logic_vector)
C = mean(character_vector)
F = mean(factor_vector)
R
L
C
F
```

```{r}
as.numeric(logic_vector)
as.numeric(character_vector)
as.numeric(factor_vector)
```



Problem 2

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(ggplot2)
```


```{r}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
summary(penguins)
nrow(penguins)
ncol(penguins)
colnames(penguins)
a = pull(penguins, var = flipper_length_mm)
b = pull(penguins, var = bill_length_mm)
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=bill_length_mm, y=flipper_length_mm)) + geom_point(aes(color = species))
```

There are 344 rows and 8 columns in the dataset.Including "species", "island", "bill_length_mm", "bill_depth_mm", "flipper_length_mm", "body_mass_g", "sex", "year" in total 8 variables. the mean of flipper length is 200.9.
