Problem 1

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
random_df = rnorm(10)
logic_vector = random_df > 0
character_vector = c("1","2","3","1","2","3", "1","2","3","2")
factor_vector = factor(c("x","y","z","x","y","z", "x","y","z","y"))
```

```{r}
R = mean(random_df)
L = mean(logic_vector)
C = mean(character_vector)
F = mean(factor_vector)
R
L
C
F
```

```{r}
as.numeric(logic_vector)
as.numeric(character_vector)
as.numeric(factor_vector)
```
