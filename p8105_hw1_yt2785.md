```

**Problem 1**

Create a data frame comprised of:

a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution; a
logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater
than 0; a character vector of length 10; a factor vector of length 10,
with 3 different factor levels;

``` r
temperature_change_df = 
  tibble(
  change_df = rnorm(10),
  vec_log = change_df > 0,
  vec_char = c("Guangzhou","New York","Shandong","Fujian","Ohio","Osaka", "Tokyo","Shanghai","LA","Hokkaido"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("China","U.S.","China","China","U.S.","Japan", "Japan","China","U.S.","Japan"))
  )
temperature_change_df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 x 4
    ##    change_df vec_log vec_char  vec_factor
    ##        <dbl> <lgl>   <chr>     <fct>     
    ##  1    -1.69  FALSE   Guangzhou China     
    ##  2     0.208 TRUE    New York  U.S.      
    ##  3     1.09  TRUE    Shandong  China     
    ##  4     0.166 TRUE    Fujian    China     
    ##  5    -0.311 FALSE   Ohio      U.S.      
    ##  6    -0.939 FALSE   Osaka     Japan     
    ##  7    -2.80  FALSE   Tokyo     Japan     
    ##  8     0.649 TRUE    Shanghai  China     
    ##  9    -1.10  FALSE   LA        U.S.      
    ## 10    -0.954 FALSE   Hokkaido  Japan

Try to take the mean of each variable in your dataframe.

``` r
change = pull(temperature_change_df, var = change_df)
logic = pull(temperature_change_df, var = vec_log)
charcter = pull(temperature_change_df, var = vec_char)
factor = pull(temperature_change_df, var = vec_factor)
mean_change = mean(change)
mean_logic = mean(logic)
mean_charcter = mean(charcter)
mean_factor = mean(factor)
mean_change
```

    ## [1] -0.5686931

``` r
mean_logic
```

    ## [1] 0.4

``` r
mean_charcter
```

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean_factor
```

    ## [1] NA

In some cases, you can explicitly convert variables from one type to
another. Write a code chunk that applies the as.numeric function to the
logical, character, and factor variables (please show this chunk but not
the output). What happens, and why? Does this help explain what happens
when you try to take the mean?

``` r
logic_num = as.numeric(logic)
character_num = as.numeric(character())
factor_num = as.numeric(factor)
mean_logic_num = mean(logic_num)
mean_character_num = mean(character_num)
mean_factor_num = mean(factor_num)
```

**Problem 2**

load the penguins dataset

Write a short description of the penguins dataset (not the penguins\_raw
dataset) using inline R code, including:

the data in this dataset, including names / values of important
variables; the size of the dataset (using nrow and ncol); the mean
flipper length

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
n_row = nrow(penguins)
n_col = ncol(penguins)
penguins_colnames = colnames(penguins)
b = pull(penguins, var = flipper_length_mm)
mean_flipper = mean(b,na.rm = TRUE)
```

**There are 344 rows and 8 columns in the dataset. Including species,
island, bill\_length\_mm, bill\_depth\_mm, flipper\_length\_mm,
body\_mass\_g, sex, year in total 8 variables. The mean of flipper
length is 200.9152047.**

Make a scatterplot of flipper\_length\_mm (y) vs bill\_length\_mm (x);
color points using the species variable (adding color = â€¦ inside of aes
in your ggplot code should help).

Export your first scatterplot to your project directory using ggsave.

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm)) + geom_point(aes(color = species))
```
