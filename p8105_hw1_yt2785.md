library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(ggplot2)
```

**Problem 1**

Create a data frame comprised of:

a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution; a
logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater
than 0; a character vector of length 10; a factor vector of length 10,
with 3 different factor levels;

``` r
temperature_change_df = 
  tibble(
  change_df = rnorm(10),
  vec_log = change_df > 0,
  vec_char = c("Guangzhou","New York","Shandong","Fujian","Ohio","Osaka", "Tokyo","Shanghai","LA","Hokkaido"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("China","U.S.","China","China","U.S.","Japan", "Japan","China","U.S.","Japan"))
  )
temperature_change_df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 x 4
    ##    change_df vec_log vec_char  vec_factor
    ##        <dbl> <lgl>   <chr>     <fct>     
    ##  1    0.0730 TRUE    Guangzhou China     
    ##  2    0.219  TRUE    New York  U.S.      
    ##  3   -0.423  FALSE   Shandong  China     
    ##  4   -0.957  FALSE   Fujian    China     
    ##  5   -0.0268 FALSE   Ohio      U.S.      
    ##  6    0.307  TRUE    Osaka     Japan     
    ##  7    0.0784 TRUE    Tokyo     Japan     
    ##  8   -1.08   FALSE   Shanghai  China     
    ##  9   -0.514  FALSE   LA        U.S.      
    ## 10    0.860  TRUE    Hokkaido  Japan

Try to take the mean of each variable in your dataframe.

``` r
change = pull(temperature_change_df, var = change_df)
logic = pull(temperature_change_df, var = vec_log)
character = pull(temperature_change_df, var = vec_char)
factor = pull(temperature_change_df, var = vec_factor)
mean_change = mean(change)
mean_logic = mean(logic)
mean_character = mean(character)
mean_factor = mean(factor)
mean_change
```

    ## [1] -0.1458812

``` r
mean_logic
```

    ## [1] 0.5

``` r
mean_character
```

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean_factor
```

    ## [1] NA

**The mean of each variable in my dataframe is -0.1458812, 0.5, NA,NA.
the mean of character and factor vector is invalid**

In some cases, you can explicitly convert variables from one type to
another. Write a code chunk that applies the as.numeric function to the
logical, character, and factor variables (please show this chunk but not
the output). What happens, and why? Does this help explain what happens
when you try to take the mean?

``` r
logic_num = as.numeric(logic)
character_num = as.numeric(character())
factor_num = as.numeric(factor)
mean_logic_num = mean(logic_num)
mean_character_num = mean(character_num)
mean_factor_num = mean(factor_num)
```

**The character vector can’t be numeric**

**Problem 2**

load the penguins dataset

Write a short description of the penguins dataset (not the penguins\_raw
dataset) using inline R code, including:

the data in this dataset, including names / values of important
variables; the size of the dataset (using nrow and ncol); the mean
flipper length

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
n_row = nrow(penguins)
n_col = ncol(penguins)
penguins_colnames = colnames(penguins)
b = pull(penguins, var = flipper_length_mm)
mean_flipper = mean(b,na.rm = TRUE)
```

**There are 344 rows and 8 columns in the dataset. Including species,
island, bill\_length\_mm, bill\_depth\_mm, flipper\_length\_mm,
body\_mass\_g, sex, year in total 8 variables. The mean of flipper
length is 200.9152047. The other important information is in the summary
below.**

``` r
summary(penguins)
```

Make a scatterplot of flipper\_length\_mm (y) vs bill\_length\_mm (x);
color points using the species variable (adding color = … inside of aes
in your ggplot code should help).

Export your first scatterplot to your project directory using ggsave.

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm)) + geom_point(aes(color = species))
```

![](p8105_hw1_yt2785_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
ggsave("penguins_plot.pdf",height = 4,width = 4)
```
